The idea behind this project is to simulate world wide web and basically 
interaction of nodes and routers for communication over a network ,
here fundamental unit would be the routers and servers.Routers can be edge/core
enterprize etc. Servers are essentially nodes and have some prorocols running on 
them. Proxy server or gateways depending on the location would hide the network 
behind them and would help in reusability of Ip addresses for example.
